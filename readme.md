This is a simple Caesar Cipher program to help encrypt, decrypt texts.
You can also use it to detect if a ciphertext was generated using a Caesar cipher.

Note that the detect mode is not 100% accurate and will instead give possible solutions.
To improve the detection accuracy, ensure words or 4 or more characters are in the text and that
the original text, when decrypted is in English.

The program will prompt you for various inputs as it requires. It can receive direct text as well as txt files.
The program can also print results to the console as well as to a txt file based on the user's choice.
